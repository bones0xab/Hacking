# Burpsuite for Pentester: Authorize
Authorize = authentication + authorization

Is an extension where we help the hack#r to detect the vulnerabilities in the website, the way she works is by letting the pentester use the request with low privilege, and he run request with the higher privilege of the admin for example.

## Common vulnerabilities detected by Authorize
RBAC: It covers where user roles or permissions are not properly enforced, 
Broken Access Control: This is where we find access controls that are not correctly implemented and lead to some recources and actions that are not authorized to be for everyone.
IDOR: Is where the attacker can make inputs and get into the data part where it can t be.
Forced Browsing: She can help see the cases where the attacker can enter to restricted areas of the application by manipulation the URLs.
Insufficient Authorization: She detects where user roles are not properly enforced.
Horizontal and vertical privilege escalation: to identify the vulnerabilities can made the hack#r made privileges 


** This is just an intro that we can made some useful operations using this Authorize **
